# FigCraft Plus — Roadmap

What we are working on, what comes next, and how to get a feature onto the list.

FigCraft Plus follows the official FigCraft releases. Each time a new FigCraft version comes out,
we first make sure every add-on still works on it, remove what FigCraft now does itself, and then
continue down this list. The work is planned in **stages**, each tied to a FigCraft version: a
stage starts once the add-ons are checked on that version. There are no dates — FigCraft's own
release pace sets them — and the plan is a forecast: requests and what FigCraft ships can move
things.

**Our three specialities:** 🎨 **Advanced color** · 🧩 **Design systems** · 🔁 **Design to code**.
Everything below serves one of them.

**Want something?** [Ask for a feature](../../issues/new?template=feature_request.yml) — and give a
👍 to the requests you'd like too. The most wanted ones move up.

| Stage | When | Theme |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | ✅ done in Plus 9 | Measurement, part 2 · contrast both ways |
| **2** | ✅ done in Plus 11 | Design system ↔ code |
| **3** | ✅ done in Plus 11 | Design System Inspector |
| **4** | ✅ done in Plus 12 | Responsive layout |
| **5** | now, on FigCraft 0.14 | Web typography and colour tokens |
| **6** | on FigCraft 0.14 | Print: resolution per frame, PDF/X |
| — | later | Export presets, design tokens exchange |

---

## ▶ Stage 5 — now, on FigCraft 0.14: web typography and colour tokens

| | Feature | What it gives you |
|---|---|---|
| ⬜ | **Line height in % from a variable** — `leading/normal = 140%` follows each text's size | Tight / Normal / Relaxed as tokens, as CSS writes them |
| ⬜ | **Gradient tokens** — a gradient style built from colour variables, with stops interpolated in OKLCH; change the palette and every gradient follows | Gradients become part of the design system (no new file format: a style with bound stops) |

## 🖨 Stage 6 — on FigCraft 0.14: print

*For print work: a frame knows the resolution it is made for, so a layout started for the screen
can become a print file without being rebuilt.*

| | Feature | What it gives you |
|---|---|---|
| ⬜ | **Resolution (DPI / PPI) per frame** — each top-level frame has its own: 72 for the web by default, 300 (or any value) for print. Set it in the frame's properties; the default for new frames in **Preferences ▸ FigCraft Plus**. Changing it **scales the frame and everything inside it** (72 → 300: ×4.17), so its physical size stays the same — a 210 × 297 mm page stays 210 × 297 mm, now 2480 × 3508 px. The frame grows from its top-left corner and **frames beside it move aside, so nothing overlaps**. Lengths in mm, cm, in and pt are read at the frame's own resolution, and exports render at it | Start in 72, finish in 300: one frame switches to print resolution, content and all, without touching the rest of the canvas. Files stay plain px for the official app (the resolution is kept as text it ignores) |
| ⬜ | **PDF/X for print** — an output intent with an ICC profile on top of FigCraft's print PDF (bleed, marks and CMYK are already FigCraft's) | Files a print shop accepts as they are |

## 📦 Later

| | Feature | What it gives you |
|---|---|---|
| ⬜ | **Export presets** — a set of sizes, formats and a file-name pattern (`{frame}_{w}x{h}`), exported in one click | Product cards and banners in every size at once |
| ⬜ | **Design tokens (DTCG) import and export** | Exchange tokens with other tools in the standard format |

## 💡 Ideas we are considering

Not planned yet — a 👍 on a [feature request](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement) helps
decide.

- Responsive component states (Desktop / Tablet / Mobile) switched by variable modes
- OKLCH tonal scale generator: 50 … 950 from one colour, as variables that follow it
- OKLCH gamut views in the picker: lightness, chroma and hue slices of the gamut, to see how far a
  colour can go
- A key to hide the selection outline while editing
- Remappable keyboard shortcuts

## Already in FigCraft — use it there

Often asked for, and FigCraft has it already, so Plus doesn't add it: **Paste to replace**
(Edit menu) · **stroke weight per side** · **variable font axes** (Typography) · **bleed, crop
marks and CMYK in the print PDF** · **line height in %** (as a value) · **layout grid styles** ·
**gradient stops bound to colour variables** · **outline view** · **variables export** (JSON, CSS,
Tailwind, Dart) **and import** (JSON) · **px or rem in Dev Mode's code** · since 0.13: **one popover
style** that closes on Escape and a press outside · **the colour picker beside the Design panel** ·
**colour variables with an alpha, and mixes of two** (as variable values) · **a portable mode**
(settings next to the app) · **custom dash patterns** for strokes.

## ✅ Done

Full details in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

| Release | Highlights |
|---|---|
| **Plus 12** | On FigCraft 0.14.0 · **sizes in %, vw and vh** that follow the parent or the viewport frame · **auto layout from variables** (direction, wrap, alignment, sizing per mode) · **align to a key object** |
| **Plus 11** | **CSS for code** (oklch, rem, relative colours, `color-mix()`, `calc()`) and **CSS import** · several text styles at once, variables bound by name · remembered missing-font replacements · the **Design System Inspector** |
| **Plus 10** | The colour picker follows the selection again (clicks on the canvas and in Layers) · *Picker follows the selection* in Preferences, to turn it off |
| **Plus 9** | On FigCraft 0.13.1 (FigCraft's own popovers now) · rulers and Dev Mode in the document's unit, the code in px or rem · number variables shown in the unit of what they size · em for line height and letter spacing · contrast both ways |
| **Plus 8** | Switch the document's unit from any length field (click its unit, or right-click) · one way to close every popover · decimals shown, 0–4 |
| **Plus 7** | **Units everywhere:** a layout unit (px, rem, mm, cm, in, pt) and a text unit (px, rem, pt) per file, in every field and on the canvas · one popover style across the Design panel |
| **Plus 6** | Contrast check against what is really under the layer (any shape behind it) · a **Libraries** tab in the colour picker with the colour variables whose scope fits |
| **Plus 5** | The Typography settings popover opens reliably, beside the panel, inside the window · screenshots of every new setting in the README |
| **Plus 4** | Typography settings (the gear): px / rem and root size per file ([FigCraft #1325](https://github.com/storytold/figcraft/issues/1325)) · Preferences ▸ FigCraft Plus: default typography unit and root size, the model the colour picker opens in |
| **Plus 3** | Print units (mm, cm, in, pt) in every field · CMYK and *Copy as* in the colour picker · WCAG / APCA contrast check |
| **Plus 2** | Derived colours and calculated variables ([requested in FigCraft #1280](https://github.com/storytold/figcraft/issues/1280)) · rem units with a root size per file ([requested in FigCraft #1325](https://github.com/storytold/figcraft/issues/1325)) |
| **Plus 1** | OKLCH the oklch.com way · colour channels from number variables · a picker that stays with what you edit · text, style and variable improvements · portable fonts folder |

## How a request gets on the roadmap

1. Open a [feature request](../../issues/new?template=feature_request.yml): what you want to do and
   why it helps.
2. Others give it a 👍; we answer in the issue.
3. Requests that help the most people, fit FigCraft and keep `.figcraft` files compatible with the
   official app go into *Ideas*, then into a release.
4. If FigCraft adds the feature itself, we use theirs and remove ours.

Bugs in FigCraft itself belong in [FigCraft's own tracker](https://github.com/storytold/figcraft/issues);
bugs in the add-ons go [here](../../issues/new?template=bug_report.yml).
